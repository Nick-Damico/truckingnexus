## Installation:

1. Copy Repository locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nick-Damico/truckingnexus.git
cd /truckingnexus
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
bundle install
```

3. Setup the database

```bash
bin/rails db:setup
```

4. Start Server

```bash
./bin/dev
# or if you use overmind
overmind start
# or just use
bin/rails server
```

### Docker

If you prefer to use Docker and have it installed

1. Modify production config `SSL` setting:

```ruby
# config/production.rb

# Force all access to the app over SSL, use Strict-Transport-Security, and use secure cookies.
config.force_ssl = false # swith to false if true
```

2. Start App and DB containers

```bash
docker compose up
```

3. Access site

```bash
localhost:3000
```

2. Stop and tear down

```bash
docker compose down --rmi all
```

## File Upload

Active Storage is using the `image_processing` gem
along with `mini_magick` gem, a lightweight wrapper around `imagemagick`.

This is used for generating variant images from attachables.
This can be changed via the `application.rb`.

Development is using local storage.
Production is using `Amazon S3`

### AWS S3

TruckingNexus is configured to use Amazon S3 in production.

You just need to setup a bucket and IAM user with policies per the documentation
form the [Rails ActiveStorage guide](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html#s3-service-amazon-s3-and-s3-compatible-apis)

**Tip:** The best way to test that the bucket and policy is setup correctly and objects are **publicly accessible**, is to update the `development.rb` config file for active_storage from `:local` to `:amazon`.

## Usage:

Trucking Nexus is designed with simplicity in mind. Sign up, browse trucking job listings, rate your experiences, access CDL test prep materials, and stay informed about the trucking industryâ€”all within a few clicks.
